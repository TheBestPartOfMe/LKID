# Game Rules

##  Players:

Two players: P1 and P2.

Players take turns, and each turn must include a move.

## Board:

A 5x5 grid.

Only one piece per square.

## Pieces:

P1 has:

- 1 Church Tower

- 1 Church Ship

- 3 Houses

P2 has:

The same setup as P1.

There is also a Priest that doesn’t belong to either player.

## Orientation:

Each building (except the Priest) has an orientation: horizontal or vertical.

## Moves:

On their turn, a player can move one of their pieces in the direction it’s facing (either horizontally or vertically) any number of steps, limited by the edges of the board and other pieces (no jumping over other pieces).

If a piece cannot move (blocked by edges or other pieces), it can swap positions with the Priest (ending the turn).

Only one action per turn is allowed.

A turn must include at least one action (no passing).

## Goal:

The objective is to create a village with a church.

The Church Ship and Church Tower must be adjacent to each other, and all houses must be connected to the church or to houses that are already connected.

The church (both the Church Ship and Church Tower) must be placed on inner squares, not on the edges.

Orientation doesn’t matter; different orientations can still form a church even if their gables cross.

## Setup:

At the start, P1 places the Church Tower in one corner and the Church Ship in the opposite corner.

P2 places their Church Tower and Church Ship in the remaining two corners.

The Priest starts in the center square.

Players take turns placing their houses, ensuring that their own houses aren’t adjacent (at least one square apart), but they can build next to the opponent’s buildings.

The orientation of the gables can be chosen freely.
